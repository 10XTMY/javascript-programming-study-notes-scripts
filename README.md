# JavaScript Practice and Study Notes

## Overview

This repository contains my personal practice and study notes, as well as scripts related to JavaScript programming. As someone who juggles multiple programming languages, I've found it invaluable to have a consolidated space to store these notes for safekeeping.

Working with various coding languages often leads to periods of time away from one or another. Having a go-to repository to brush up on the fundamentals can be incredibly helpful..

The repository is organized into various folders and files, each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript programming. Notes are in the comments within scripts. Here's a general overview of what you can expect to find:

- **OOP**: OOP in JS, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Fundamentals**: Syntax, data types, control structures etc.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Deep dives into callbacks, promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.
- **DOM**: Interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM), manipulating elements, etc.
- **Async**: Asynchronous JS, including callbacks, promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.
- **Forms**: Working with forms, form validation, etc.
- **Events**: Event handling, event bubbling, etc.
- **Storage**: Local storage, session storage, etc.
- **Babel**: A JS compiler that allows you to use the latest features of the JavaScript.
  Babel converts ECMAScript 2015+ code (also known as ES6 and newer versions) into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can run in older browsers or environments. This includes transforming new syntax and language features (like arrow functions, classes, template literals, etc.) into older syntax that is more widely supported.
- **Webpack**: A static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.
  In your Webpack configuration file (commonly webpack.config.js), you set up a rule that tells Webpack to use babel-loader for processing .js files (or other extensions you might be using that compile to JavaScript, like .jsx for React).
- **React**: For an example of a React front end to a Django RestAPI, see the [Django Photographer's Website](https://github.com/10XTMY/pixfina)
